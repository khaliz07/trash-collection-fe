# Rule Management

## Context
- When managing project rules and documentation
- When creating or updating rule files
- When organizing project structure and guidelines

## Critical Rules
- All project rules must be documented in MEMORY_BANK.md
- Do not create separate rule files for different features
- Update rules continuously as project evolves
- Keep all rules in a single, centralized location
- Ensure rules are always in sync with current project structure
- Remove outdated or redundant rules
- Follow the rule file naming convention: `{rule-name}-{type}.mdc`
- Place rule files in appropriate organizational folders:
  - `.cursor/rules/always/` - Rules applied to every chat
  - `.cursor/rules/auto-attached/` - Rules applied when file pattern matches
  - `.cursor/rules/agent-requested/` - Rules loaded by agent when needed
  - `.cursor/rules/manual/` - Rules that need to be explicitly mentioned

## Examples

<example>
✅ Correct Rule Management:
- Update MEMORY_BANK.md when project structure changes
